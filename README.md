🚀 DevOps Project: Manage Spotify with Terraform!🎶


I’m excited to share a hands-on DevOps project where you can create and manage Spotify playlists with Terraform, embracing the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. This project provides a fantastic way to deepen your understanding of Terraform concepts like providers, data blocks, and more.

🌟 Project Highlights

In this project, Terraform is used to automate creating playlists on Spotify for various moods and times of day — think morning tunes, party night, and more. No more manually curating playlists; instead, let Terraform handle it for you!



🔧 Prerequisites:

1. Terraform & Docker: Install and set up on your machine.

2. Spotify Account: Any Spotify account will do!

3. Developer Access: Create a Spotify Developer app to get your Client ID and Secret.

4. Spotify Provider for Terraform: Install this to work with Spotify’s API.

5. Code Editor: VS Code recommended for smooth editing.



📝Project Steps:

1. Create Terraform Code: Start a new project folder and add `main.tf`.

2. Define Provider: Set up the Spotify provider.

3. Obtain API Key: Get your Client ID and Secret from the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

4. Run Auth Proxy: Use Docker to authenticate and connect Terraform to Spotify.

5. Apply Terraform Config: Initialize and apply your configuration to generate playlists automatically.



🎉Outcome:

After configuring, check Spotify to see playlists generated for each mood. Customize as you go! This project is a fun way to build Terraform skills while automating your music experience.
